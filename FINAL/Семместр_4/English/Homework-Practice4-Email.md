Hy my friend,

You asked me about buying product online in your letter. I will be happy to talk about tihs.

First, you have to sign in your account. Secondly, you have to choose product, add it to the basket and place an order. After that  you go to the checkout.  Then you complete payment instructions. Your bank will check ability to pay and send confirmation or rejection. If successfull you can wait your order. 
For example, I bought the notebook in marketplace. I added them to the basket. Then I paid with my card. And I got the notebooks at the pick-up point. 

I hope this description can help you.

Best wishes,
Roman
