In 2018, my family and I had a wonderful winter holiday in Moscow. Firstly, we visited the Red Square. There was a big christmas tree. It glowed and shimmered. After that we had a lunch in cafe.  Then we went to the VDNH. We visited the space museum. There was many models of spacecraft. Also we visited the mirror maze. There was a feeling in the mirror maze that I wasn't in real. It was like a dream. Next, we went out and took many photos. Also I remember the Moscow metro. Each station was very beautiful and clean.  I enjoyed this trip. I want to go again.
