Hi my friend,

How are you? I'm good. In this letter, I want to share my favorite websites with you.

The first website is the Codewars. It's very useful site for programming because it helps to level up coding skills. On the site, there are a lot of different tasks. I like rating system on the site.

The second website is the Yandex Music. It's very beautiful and user-friendly website. i listen to music everyday so I use this site. Also I like a function of choice music according to mood or activity.

And finally website is the YouTube. It's entertaiment website. There are a lot of different videos. I use this site when I'm relaxing or studying. 

This was my top 3 favorite website. Which websites do you like? Can you share it with me?

Best wishes,
Roman
