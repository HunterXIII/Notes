**Customer:** Hi! My computer is running very slowly, and sometimes it makes strange noises. What’s wrong with it?

**Technician:** Hello! Let me check. It seems like there’s an issue with the **hard drive**. It might be damaged or overloaded. We’ll need to **replace** it with a new one.

**Customer:** What about my files? I don’t want to lose them.

**Technician:** Before replacing it, we should **backup files**. You can save your data to an external drive or cloud storage.

**Customer:** Got it. What else needs to be done?

**Technician:** After the **backup**, I’ll **install** the new **hard drive** and check the **data cable**—sometimes they’re not connected properly. I’ll also inspect the **cooling fan** to make sure the computer doesn’t overheat.

**Customer:** How long will it take?

**Technician:** About 2 hours. If the **cooling fan** is fine and the **data cable** isn’t damaged, it’ll be quick.

**Customer:** Okay, let’s do it. Thanks!

**Technician:** No problem! After the replacement, I recommend regularly **updating software**—it helps prevent issues.

**Customer:** Will do!
