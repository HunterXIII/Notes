Questions for speaking: 

1) What are browser cookies?
Cookies are small files that are placed on a user's computer when they visit a website.

**Cookies** (often known as internet cookies) are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a network.
2) What are cookies used for?
Basically, Cookies are created so that the website can find out what activity the user has done in the past.
For example, Cookies allow a site to track the buttons or pages that have been opened by the user in a previous session. Cookies may also store information such as name, email address, and home or work address.

Specific cookies are used to identify specific users and improve their web browsing experience. Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer. When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve you.
    **Session management:** For example, cookies let websites recognize users and recall their individual login information and preferences, such as sports news versus politics.
    **Personalization:** Customized advertising is the main way cookies are used to personalize your sessions. You may view certain items or parts of a site, and cookies use this data to help build targeted ads that you might enjoy. They’re also used for language preferences as well.
    **Tracking:** Shopping sites use cookies to track items users previously viewed, allowing the sites to suggest other goods they might like and keep items in shopping carts while they continue shopping on another part of the website. They will also track and monitor performance analytics, like how many times you visited a page or how much time you spent on a page.

3) What is the difference between cookies and cache?
The main difference between the two is that cache only stores data online for the purpose of speeding up access to the browser or application. Meanwhile, Cookies store information about the activities you do on a website so that the site can display content that suits you.
4) What are HTTP cookies?
**HTTP cookies,** or internet cookies, are built specifically for web browsers to track, personalize and save information about each user’s session. A “session” is the word used to define the amount of time you spend on a site. Cookies are created to identify you when you visit a new website. The web server — which stores the website’s data — sends a short stream of identifying information to your web browser in the form of cookies. This identifying data (known sometimes as “browser cookies”) is processed and read by “name-value” pairs. These pairs tell the cookies where to be sent and what data to recall.
5) How can you enable and remove cookies?
**If you enable and allow cookies,** it can streamline your web-surfing experience. Here’s how to allow cookies:
- Find the cookie section — typically under Settings Privacy.
- Click the boxes to allow cookies. Sometimes the option says, allow “local” data.
- If you don’t want cookies, you can simply uncheck these boxes.

**Removing cookies** can help you mitigate your risks of privacy breaches. It can also reset your browser tracking and personalization. Removing normal cookies is easy, but it could make certain web sites harder to navigate. Without cookies, internet users may have to re-enter their data for each visit. Different browsers store cookies in different places, but usually, you can:

- Find the Settings, Privacy section — sometimes listed under Tools, Internet Options, or Advanced.
- Follow the prompts on the available options to manage or remove cookies.  
    

However, to remove persistent tracking cookie infestations and more malicious types created by hackers, you’ll want to enlist the help of some [Premium Protection](https://www.kaspersky.com/premium). In the future, you should also anonymize your web use by using a  [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.kaspersky.com/vpn-secure-connection). These services tunnel your web connection to a remote server that poses as you. Cookies will then be labeled for that remote server in another country, instead of your local computer.
