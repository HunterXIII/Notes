Dear friend,

Thank you for your letter. You asked me about working at the computer. I'm ready to tell you about my computer experience.

I use my computer every day for different tasks. I usually study on the computer. For example, I can write notes on lessons,  create presentation or programming. Also I often play computer games with my friends at the weekends. And I watch films and videos in the Internet. There are a lot of advantages of using computer. For example, I can talk with my friend from other cities. Also I has access to a lot of information so I can find the answer to my question very quickly. And there are some difficulties with working at the computers I has faced. For example, my eyes are getting tired when I am sitting at the computer a long time. Also I sometimes spend a lot of time to find the necessary information. I mustn't be distracted when I am working at the computer. Also I must take a break every 2 hours. This can help you stay productive when working at a computer.

I hope this helps you.

Best wishes,
Roman
