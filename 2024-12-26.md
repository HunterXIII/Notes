Hi Jake,
You asked me about Data Processing steps. So I'm going to answer you.
First, it's a data collection. You have to gather raw date which you want to process. Second step is called data sorting. You need to create categories to organise the data into groups. After that, data coding. It is arrange and systemise the data. Next, you have to enter the data into system. It is called data entry. Then, it's data validation. You need to clean the data and double-check for mistakes. And finally, it's data tabulation. You have to arrange the data into table format so that it can be analysed. 
I hope this description help in your work. Also you can ask me if you don't understand something.
Best wishes,
Roman
